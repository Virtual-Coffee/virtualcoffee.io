Onboarding processes can be confusing. This is just as true for software as it is for communities!

We get many questions such as "I have some questions or ideas. How and where should I ask this?" "Do we have a channel for {'{'}something{'}'}?" "How do I find a channel in Slack?" "I would like to help. How do I volunteer?" And many more!

We hear you! That's why we provide the Guides To Virtual Coffee as a user guide for you to get the most out of our community!
