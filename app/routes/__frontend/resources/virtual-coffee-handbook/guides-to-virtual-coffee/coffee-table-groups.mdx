Coffee Table Groups are small, special interest groups created and run by our members. They can involve Zoom meetings, async Slack hangouts, or anything else the members want to do.

In this article, you will find the list of our current Coffee Table Groups based on the day and time of the events. You can contact the group's Leader for any questions or ask for more information, and you are most welcome to join!
