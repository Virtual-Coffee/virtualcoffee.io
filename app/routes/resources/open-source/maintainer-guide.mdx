## Repository Checklist

Suppose you are a maintainer looking to open an open source project for contributions. In that case, this checklist will help you to get your repository into a good state to start receiving external contributions.

Here's the checklist. For more detailed explanation of these points, check out [this section](/resources/open-source/maintainer-guide/#preparing-a-project-for-open-source-contributions). It isn't necessary for a project in the wild to have _all_ of these things, but it should have most of them.

<dl>
  <dt>✅ It should have a relevant name.</dt>
  <dd>

  </dd>
  <dt>✅ It should have a description.</dt>
  <dd>
    The description should clearly describes what the project does and is for.

    If your project is participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), you should also write the Hacktoberfest topic here. Or you can add the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label to the accepted pull requests.

  </dd>
  <dt>✅ It should have relevant tags.</dt>
  <dd>
    These tags should highlight its scope, stack, field, etc.

  </dd>
  <dt>✅ It should have a README file.</dt>
  <dd>
    The README should link to or describe:

    - Project purpose and context
    - Installation instructions

  </dd>
  <dt>✅ A CONTRIBUTIONS/CONTRIBUTING markdown file.</dt>
  <dd>
    It provides contribution guide and consist of:

    - The recommended process for making issues/submitting pull requests.
    - Ways to communicate with the maintainers.

  </dd>
  <dt>✅ A valid open source license.</dt>
  <dd>
    A license is **essential**. A project is not an open source if it doesn't have a valid open source license.

  </dd>
  <dt>✅ A Code of Conduct (COC).</dt>
  <dd>
    The Code of Conduct (COC) is an excellent indicator of a healthy contributor's environment.
  </dd>
  <dt>✅ Issue and Pull request templates.</dt>
  <dd>
    These templates guide potential contributors on making issues and pull requests to the project. They remove a lot of burden from the maintainer and the contributor from guessing the appropriate procedure for these contributions.
  </dd>
</dl>

## Preparing a project for Open Source contributions

<LeadText>

This section addresses the **minimum** requirements, highlighting key areas and considerations to help you evaluate whether or not your open source project is ready for contributions. When Virtual Coffee determines the projects we highlight and recommend to our members, these are the things we look for and why. Hopefully, it can serve as a guide to anyone who finds this document.

</LeadText>

### Name, Description, Tags

We'll start with the natural beginning for evaluating an open source project: The descriptive fields that GitHub provides.

- It should have a relevant name.
- It should have a description that clearly describes what the project does and is for.
- It should have relevant tags highlighting its scope, stack, field, etc.

These are the first and most straightforward ways GitHub uses to recommend your content to potential contributors.

If you want your open source project to participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), adding the `hacktoberfest` tag to your repo description is one essential way to indicate that.

An example of a good name, description, and tag:

![A good open source description](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13292886/132138464-242c7d64-8b64-4595-b045-8bf028638b43.png)

### Documentation

Good documentation is the best indicator that a project is well maintained, well supported, and has a healthy and active community. There are a plethora of materials a repo can utilize to provide context to potential contributors, but the docs that matter most are:

#### The README

README is the face of your repo. It's the first thing anyone sees, after maybe the name and description, and it's the nexus for all content, links, docs, and other project associations. A project without a README is probably not ready to accept contributions. Some basic things you should include in your README are:

- A more detailed description of the project than the description field in GitHub.
- How to install/run your application or a link to the document that explains it. The more detailed, the better.
- A link to the Code of Conduct.
- Project status, roadmap, and other pertinent details for those interested in using or contributing to the project.

🔎 Example: [Virtual Coffee's README](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/README.md)

#### The Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct (COC) is an excellent indicator of a healthy contributor's environment. There are many Code of Conduct styles online, and many projects use one of the standard templates. But it's always worth looking at a project's Code of Conduct before starting any contribution work. Not every open source project may necessarily have one. Some maintainers opt to describe appropriate behavior in the README file.

🔎 Example: [Virtual Coffee's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

#### The Contributing Guide

Last but certainly not least, there should be some discussion of how to contribute to the project. Some people write these instructions directly in the README, which _can_ be alright. Still, we prefer an explicit document that highlights:

- The recommended process for making issues/submitting pull requests.
- What to do if you feel like somebody is violating the Code of Conduct?
- How to communicate with maintainers? How often should you expect interactions/reviews, and through what mediums?

🔎 Example: [Virtual Coffee's Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

#### The License

Many [popular and vetted open source licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses) make it easy and safe for people to contribute to a particular project. Unless you are a lawyer or have access to one, it is advised to use one of these.

🔎 Example: [Virtual Coffee's open source license](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)

### Issue and Pull Request templates

These templates guide potential contributors on making issues and pull requests to the project. They remove a lot of burden from the maintainer and the contributor from guessing the appropriate procedure for these contributions.

![Templates](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13292886/132138524-0a38d35c-305e-4804-ba36-e7adfa73e09d.png)

🔎 Example: [Virtual Coffee's issue templates](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE), and [this is what users see](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/issues/new/choose) when submitting a new issue.

### Beginner Friendliness

Suppose you want to make your repository/project beginner friendly. In that case, you should have some indications in the documentation and processes that highlight that.

<dl>
	<dt>Call to action.</dt>
	<dd>
		Some repositories say "contributions welcome/beginner friendly" in the
		README or have tags on issues for beginners. Either way, there should be
		some indication that you do want someone to help.
	</dd>
	<dt>Healthy interactions with contributors.</dt>
	<dd>
		Unless a project is brand new, it likely has some history of contributions
		from others. Looking at those interactions and how the maintainers work with
		contributors is a great way for contributors to get the "vibe" of the
		project. How often do maintainers respond? How do they respond? Are people
		appreciated for their work? If you intend to make your repository/project
		beginner friendly, bear this in mind.
	</dd>
	<dt>Clear tagging system in issues.</dt>
	<dd>
		The easier it is to navigate the project issues and resources, the more
		friendly it is for new contributors.
	</dd>
</dl>

_Note that everyone has a slightly different definition of "beginner friendly", so the experience may vary in different repositories, which is okay._

### Open sourcing a project without expecting contributions

If you want to open source your project so that other people can freely use the fruits of your labor, you don't have to do everything on the checklist.

For example, you probably won't need issue and pull request templates or a contributing guide. A Code of Conduct, however, is still recommended. Even if you are not expecting contributions, you may still get public activity on your repo, for example, on issues. It helps you set boundaries and keep conversations respectful.

## Best practices for maintainers

### Communication with contributors

Communication is key to running a successful open source project. Establish conventions for communications early on and make sure these are well documented. Many projects communicate via issues and pull requests. Some use external platforms such as Slack, a forum, IRC, or email lists. All are good ways to communicate. The important thing is to figure out what is most appropriate for your project. Using issues and pull requests is a solid choice if you are unsure what is best.

Suppose you are maintaining a company project that is open to external contributors. In that case, you need to coordinate internal and external communication so that outside contributors don't miss out on essential updates communicated internally.

Regardless of the tools used to communicate, there are certain things to keep in mind to keep communication effective and respectful, especially in an international online space.

<dl>
	<dt>Have a Code of Conduct</dt>
	<dd>All communication should follow the Code of Conduct.</dd>
	<dt>Messages should be kept short and simple.</dt>
	<dd>
		It is often best to keep to 'one message, one topic'. However, there may be
		times when this is not possible. For example, if you will be unavailable for
		some time and need to respond to several points. If you need to discuss
		several topics in one message, put each in a separate paragraph.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		Disagreement and debate are healthy, but it is important to keep the
		conversation respectful.
	</dt>
	<dd>
		You could criticize the ideas people express, but don't criticize the person
		directly.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		Low-context communication works best in international, cross-cultural
		spaces.
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Meanings should be explicit in the words you use. People from different
		cultures might not understand specific cultural references, cliches, and
		sayings.
	</dd>
</dl>

### Managing expectations

It is important to effectively manage both maintainers and contributors' expectations to ensure a project's smooth running with external contributors.

Here are several things that maintainers can do to help manage the expectations:

- Breaking down tasks for external contributors into small, well-defined chunks.
- Ensuring that any preferences for code style, branch names, git workflows, etc., are well explained in the contributing guide or README.
- Communicating what support you can provide for contributors if any (e.g., pair programming, answering questions, etc.).
- Communicating the availability and expected timescales for reviewing pull requests.

### Building community

A strong community around an open source project can be crucial to the project's success. An active community around an open source project will help the maintainers handle support, spread the word, and bring new users and contributors to the project. They also allow maintainers to get feedback and new ideas to help the project fulfill the needs and aspirations of users.

Building a community takes effort and is equally important as the technical development effort. It is about both tools enabling community building and making and nurturing connections with and between people.

Things that will help build community:

<dl>
	<dt>A place for discussion to happen.</dt>
	<dd>
		It could be GitHub issues for smaller projects where the community focuses
		on project questions and development discussions. For larger projects or if
		you want to build a community in a broader sense, a separate venue such as a
		Slack or Discord community or forum will probably work better.
	</dd>
	<dt>A Code of Conduct</dt>
	<dd>
		It sets boundaries for interaction and keeps the community a welcoming space
		for everyone.
	</dd>
	<dt>Community documentation.</dt>
	<dd>
		It explains how the community works and where to search for things related
		to the community. For example, here at Virtual Coffee, we have our [Member
		Resources](https://virtualcoffee.io/resources/virtual-coffee/) page.
	</dd>
	<dt>
		Leading with empathy and kindness, welcoming new people, and helping them
		find their way in the community.
	</dt>
	<dd>
		Joining a new community where you don't know the people can be an
		intimidating experience, and you can go a long way to ease the journey.
	</dd>
</dl>

### Avoiding burnout

Maintaining an open source project can be a lot of work, and many people do it simultaneously with their "day job". It is essential to be mindful of the risk of burnout and take steps to keep the work at a manageable level.

Figure out a reasonable time frame for responding to issues and pull requests, and include it in your documentation. If you are an individual maintaining a repository in your spare time, it's okay to say a week.

If you are maintaining a company repository, state your working hours in the documentation and clarify that you won't respond outside of office hours. Make sure you stick to this.
