			<h3 className="font-italic">March Recap</h3>
			<p>
				Monthly challenge -&gt;
				<a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/mar-2022/">

				We spent the month of March creating cool video content and sharing
				knowledge with others.
			</p>

			<h3 className="mb-3 font-italic">VC Phase Three</h3>
			<p>
				It’s almost been two years since the first Virtual Coffee happened.
				We’ve met so many new friends, learned and grew together, and formed
				into the welcoming community we have today.
			</p>
			<p>
				As we move into this third year of Virtual Coffee, the maintainers--with
				the help of a team of invested community members--have made the decision
				to pause new membership while we work on finding the best ways to
				support our existing community and define what the new year will look
				like for us all.
			</p>
