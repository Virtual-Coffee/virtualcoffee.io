## Coffees (Virtual Coffee Weekly Zoom Chats)

<LeadText>

We have <Link href="/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/guides-to-virtual-coffee/glossary#coffees">Coffee</Link> on **Tuesdays at 9:00 AM ET** and **Thursdays at 12:00 PM ET** that last an hour. This is a good place and time to meet and get to know other members, old and new, through casual conversations.

</LeadText>

### How It Works

After some pre-coffee chatter, our MC will make an intro with some background and important announcements while people filter in. Then we'll break the crowd into breakout rooms for more relaxed and intimate conversations.

When we move to the small group conversations, there will be a <Link href="/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/guides-to-virtual-coffee/glossary#room-leader">Room Leader</Link> and <Link href="/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/guides-to-virtual-coffee/glossary#note-taker">Note Taker</Link> for the room. They'll explain how we do introductions and how to participate. We value our members and the ways they're most comfortable participating.

If you're here to listen and chill? No problem! If you can't turn on your camera or aren't comfortable having your camera or even sound on? Feel free to turn them off! There is no obligation for you to have them on. We want you to be as comfortable as possible in our Coffees.

We drop the schedule in the `#announcement` channel on Slack every Monday and the day of the Coffee. There will also be an announcement to join the Coffee in the `#vc-events` channel 10 minutes before the Coffee start, along with the link to join.

### Joining Coffees

- Head over to the `#vc-events` channel on Slack.
- Click the "Join Event" button to join the Coffee.

Now you will be directed to the Coffee's Zoom.

## Virtual Coffee on Slack

<LeadText>

Much of Virtual Coffee occurs on Slack. We have channels in our Slack to accommodate our members, and we encourage you to participate in Slack to get the most out of Virtual Coffee!

</LeadText>

### Slack Channels

See our <Link href="/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/guides-to-virtual-coffee/slack-channels-guide">Virtual Coffee Slack Channels Guide</Link> for the complete list of our Slack channels.

And read our tips around Slack in the next section if you need to familiarize yourself with Slack.

### Tips Around Slack

#### ➡️ Using Tags

You can tag members (e.g., `@name`) to notify them about your thread and draw their attention.

But unless you are a Maintainer or granted permission by a Maintainer, don't use `@here` or `@channel`.
Using these tags will notify everyone in the channel. It might be an afternoon at your time, but that means it's midnight for some members. We want to respect all time zones.

#### ➡️ One Topic, One Thread

Keep one topic in one thread. If you need to add more information to your message or you want to reply to a message, do that _in the thread_ and not create a new message to avoid confusion. Doing this will keep the topics and the conversations in the channels easy to follow by other members.

##### On a Computer

- Hover over the thread.
- Click the speech bubble emoji. (If you hover over it, a tooltip will say "Reply to thread".)

##### On a Phone

- Press on the thread.
- Press where it says "Reply in thread", and start typing.

Or

- Long press on the thread.
- Press "Reply in thread", and start typing.

#### ➡️ Bookmarks and Pinned Messages

You can check bookmarks and pinned messages on the top of each channel to find important and helpful links or resources around the community.

#### ➡️ Including Code Snippets in a Message

When you need to share code snippets in your message, you want to ensure it's well-formatted to make it readable and easy to understand. There are code and code block buttons in the text formatting menu. You can also create this formatting with backticks.

##### Inline Code

Use a single backtick (`) to share technical jargon or a one-line code in a sentence.
For example:

```text
If you use `npm`, run `npm list -g` to see all packages you've installed globally.
```

##### Code Block

Use triple backtick (```) to share a code block.
For example:

````text
```
function greetings() {
  console.log("Hello there!");
}
```
````

#### ➡️ View Channels Before Joining
