## Definitions

### What Is Git?

We like this Git definition from [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/source-control/git/):

> Git is a distributed, open-source version control system (VCS) that enables you to store code, track revision history, merge code changes, and revert to earlier code version when needed.

### What Is GitHub?

Like GitLab and Bitbucket, GitHub is a platform for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on Git repositories. <br />
You can interact with GitHub through the web GUI on [their website](https://github.com), and there is also a [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) if you prefer working with the command line.

## Basic Workflows to Contribute to the Open Source Using Git and GitHub

### Forking a Repository

Suppose you want to contribute to an open source project. In that case, the first step is to fork the repository to your GitHub account.
Most open sources do not allow you to make and push changes directly in their repository. That's why you want to fork the repository.

Forking means you create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account to make changes without pushing commits directly to the project's original repository.

The steps to do so are:

1. Click the "Fork" button on the project's repository page on GitHub.
2. GitHub will redirect you to the "Create a new fork" page. Click the "Create fork" button.

By convention, this forked repository is called the `origin` repository.

### Authenticating with GitHub

Suppose you work for the first time with GitHub locally. In that case, you want to know about authenticating your local Git with GitHub before cloning a repository.

You must provide your email and credential whenever you clone a repository, commit and push changes, or do other Git activities related to GitHub locally.
That is a way for GitHub to authenticate you as a user.
But you can set up your credentials locally, so you don't have to input them whenever you do a Git activity.

There are three ways to clone a repository:

- **[HTTPS](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github#https)** <br />
  HTTPS is the most common one to use. You must create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to enter when GitHub prompts your password.

- **[SSH (Secure Shell)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github#ssh)** <br />
  SSH provides an encrypted way to exchange information safely. You can [read here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to generate a new SSH key on GitHub.

- **[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)** <br />
  You can copy and run the command in your terminal using GitHub CLI.

### Cloning a Repository

When you want to start working on a change, you want to clone the project's repository after you fork it. That way, you can work on it in the local environment.

The steps to clone a repository:

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the green "Code" button.
3. Choose how you want to clone it—through HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI. <br />
   For this example, we will use HTTPS.
4. Copy the URL.
5. In your terminal, run:

   ```bash
   git clone repo-url
   ```

   Change the `repo-url` to the copied URL of the forked repository. <br />
   Running this command will set up a copy of the repository on your local computer for you to work with.

### Adding an `upstream` Remote Repository

Even though you've cloned the forked repository, you may also want to add the original repository as one of your remote repositories.
This original repository is conventionally called `upstream`. By doing this, you can pull other people's changes into your local repository whenever you need.

To add an `upstream` repository, run this command:

```bash
git remote add upstream repo-url
```

Change the `repo-url` with the URL of the original repository.

### Check the Added Remote Repositories

Now you have the `origin` and `upstream` as your remote repositories. You can check if they've been appropriately added by running this command:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Running this command will give you a list of your remote repositories.

### Create a New Branch

Now you're ready to work on the changes. _Always work on changes in a new branch, not directly in the `main` or `master` branch_.
This new branch is what you will later push to the remote repository.

To create a new branch, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

Change `new-branch-name` to whatever you want.

### Add and Commit Changes

Say that you've finished making changes and are ready to push your changes to GitHub. You first need to add and commit your changes.

#### Add Changes

Run `git add .` to add all new and modified files to the Git staging area.

Or run `git add path` if you want to add a specific directory or file. <br />
Change `path` to the path of the file that you want to add. For example:

```bash
git add styles/header.css
```

#### Commit Changes

Now you can 'save' your changes by committing with this command:

```bash
git commit -m "Your message"
```

Change `Your message` into a short description of your changes. For example:

```bash
git commit -m "Add navbar to the homepage"
```

#### Run `git status`

You can check if your changes have been added or committed by running the `git status` command in your terminal.
This command will let you know the state of your Git working directory and staging area.

### Fetching `upstream` Changes

Sometimes, someone works in the same file as you. And maybe, that person already pushed their changes and got their pull request merged into the `main` branch on the `upstream` repository while you are working on yours locally.
So you always want to ensure that your fork is up to date with the `upstream` repository.

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Sync fork" button under the green "Code" button.
3. If the buttons are inactive, the repository has no changes. You can <Link href="/resources/developer-resources/open-source/git-101#push-changes">push your changes</Link> and <Link href="/resources/developer-resources/open-source/git-101#making-a-pull-request">make a pull request</Link> in that case. <br />
   But when the button is green with "Update branch" stated, you want to click it.

Now your fork has the same update as the `upstream` repository.

### Synchronizing Changes Locally

Now that your `origin` repository is in sync with the `upstream`, you want to synchronize these changes locally. That way, you already have the most updated content when you push your changes.

You want to fetch and merge the latest update into your working branch.
In your terminal, make sure that you're in your working branch. Then run:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Change `main` to `master` if the repository uses `master` as the name of its default branch. <br />
The command fetches the updated `main` branch from the `origin` repo and merges that branch into your local working branch.

In this step, you should resolve some merge conflicts, if any.

### Resolve Merge Conflicts

It's common to encounter merge conflicts when contributing to open source.
Conflicts usually occur when changes are on the same line(s), in the same file(s), from 2 different branches.

Say you forget or haven't fetched the `upstream` and synchronized it with the `origin` and local repositories before pushing your changes.
When you're about to create a pull request on GitHub, you will get notified about the conflicts, if any.

There are two ways to resolve conflicts:

1. Directly on GitHub

   You will get a notification prompt that your branch has conflicts that must be resolved. <br />
   Click on the "Resolve conflict" button to fix the conflicts.

   ![conflict-github.JPG](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1646421795534/cuEiIEKgT.JPG)

   However, the best way is to resolve them in your local environment.

2. In the local environment

   - Do all the steps in <Link href="/resources/developer-resources/open-source/git-101#fetching-upstream-changes">Fetching `upstream` Changes</Link> and <Link href="/resources/developer-resources/open-source/git-101#synchronizing-changes-locally">Synchronizing Changes Locally</Link> sections.<br />
     Then you will see this in your text editor:

     ![git conflict.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1662321487768/YXuwvPrzz.jpg)

     <br />

   - Select one of the options:

     - Accept Current Change—when you _only_ want to keep your change.
     - Accept Incoming Change—when you _only_ want to keep the incoming change.
     - Accept Both Changes—when you want to keep both your and the incoming changes.

After resolving the conflicts, if necessary, you can fix and adjust the codes. Then <Link href="/resources/developer-resources/open-source/git-101#add-and-commit-changes">add and commit the changes</Link>.

### Push Changes

You have fetched and synchronized updates and also added and committed the changes. Now you can push your changes to the remote repository.
Remember that you will push these changes to the `origin` repository.

To do so, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git push origin branch-name
```

Change the `branch-name` to your working branch name.

### Making a Pull Request

Once you have pushed your changes to the `origin` repository, you can submit the changes to the `upstream` repository by making a pull request.

Creating a pull request allows the maintainers to review your work, comment, and request any necessary changes. They will then decide whether to merge or not merge your changes into the project codebase.

The steps to make a pull request:

1. Go to the `upstream` repository at GitHub and click the green "New pull request" button. If you have recently pushed changes to GitHub, you should see a banner at the top of the page with a "Compare and pull request" button that you can click on.
2. You will then get taken to the "Open pull request" form, where you can create a description of your pull request. Many projects provide a pull request template within the form to help you get it right. But if they don't, you should check the project's Contributing guidelines (usually written in the CONTRIBUTIONS/CONTRIBUTING markdown file) and follow any conventions described.
3. Once ready, click the "Create pull request" button.

Congratulations! You have made your pull request 🎉!

If a maintainer requests changes, you can make the requested changes and push new commits to the same branch. They will automatically be added to the pull request.

## Advanced Git and GitHub Workflows

<LeadText>

The following workflows are helpful when collaborating with another person in open source.

</LeadText>

### Asynchronous Collaboration on a Shared Branch Between Two Different Forks

Let's assume you and your teammate, Alice, forked a project repository. You will collaborate on the same issue in the same file asynchronously. Each of you will do the same steps.

In this example, we will walk you through your point of view.

#### Add a Remote Repository

Add Alice's fork as a remote on your local repository by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add alice repo-url
```

Change `repo-url` to the URL of Alice's fork.

We use `alice` as the name of the remote repository as an example because we add Alice's fork as one of our remote repositories. But you can name this anything you want.

#### Fetch Branches

Fetch Alice's branches by running this command:

```bash
git fetch alice
```

#### Go to the Target Branch

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

Change `branch-name` to the target branch name at Alice's fork.

#### Pull the Changes

Pull the changes pushed by Alice with this command:

```bash
git pull alice branch-name
```

Now you have the updated branch version with the changes from your teammate.

You or Alice can submit the pull request once you have done all the work.
Each commit will automatically contain either your or Alice's name. So, both of your contributions are identified.

### Synchronous Collaboration

Say sometimes you work synchronously with Alice and Charlie on the same issue. All steps are the same as the asynchronous collaboration above. But in sync collaboration, you want to [include them in your commit message as co-authors](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors).

```bash
git commit -m  "Add new feature
>
>
Co-authored-by: Alice <alice@email.com>
Co-authored-by: Charlie <charlie@email.com>"
```

**Notes**:

- Because you are the one who commits the changes, you don't need to include your name in the commit message.
- Always give two empty spaces by hitting enter before writing "Co-authored-by".
- Do not close the commit message with double quotes (") before you add the "Co-authored-by:".
- Close the commit message with double quotes (") at the last line of "Co-authored-by:".
- Use the email address associated with your teammate's GitHub account.

## Getting the Most Out of Your GitHub Profile

Do you know that you can customize your GitHub profile? You can add a short bio, website, and social media links and customize your pinned repositories to showcase the work you most want the world to see. It would be like a mini portfolio of your own!

![An example profile page](https://ams03pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mRCWqe-HFTvjsstwwqyHWhS3sithntcM0bpqad2-S6_2dMCx982CrqDnV9bxVSWrdbFRDNpcqdnte5FqHahDqB4tcxDb8xFVg4l2nMT_4X7pFQ4fm80S1gFaaqh9hy5cNH8hZ8xHE1Tj9XtzhpKE6eMiFnGFR6OqeRXfxNECArhp2ZQoOAngWRPXpqJm7KVid?width=821&height=907&cropmode=none)

### How Does It Work?

To customize your profile, create a repository in your account with the same name as your GitHub username and pop in a README. The contents of that README file will get rendered on your profile page. You can add all kinds of cool integrations to this README to do awesome things on your profile.
