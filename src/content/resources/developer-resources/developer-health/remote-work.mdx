## Introduction

Explaining the shift to remote work and its impact on developers.

## Optimizing Your Home Office Setup

- **Ergonomics**:

Ergonomics can help you feel more comfortable, both physically and mentally,
which can lead to higher productivity. For example, an ergonomically designed workstation
can help improve posture, which can reduce fatigue and exertion.
This can allow you to focus on their work for longer periods of time and complete tasks more efficiently.

Poor ergonomics can lead to frustration and fatigue.
Ergonomic workstations can help you feel less tension in your body,
which can lead to higher quality work.

- **Technology**:

### A good monitor

Having a good amount of screen space makes working on projects more efficient and easier on the eyes

### Desk/Standing Desk

Lots of developers who work from home have standing desks (some with treadmills!) This helps keep the blood flowing and
helps keep you active

Dedicate a designated work space in your home. A closet, a corner in the living room,
or if you're fortunate enough to have the space, and entire home office.

Try to compartmentalize your work from your home life.
It is important that your mind have a space to rest and regenerate.

  your coworkers. A virtual space can be as real as a physical enviroment.
