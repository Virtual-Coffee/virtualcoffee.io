			<p>
				Monthly challenge -&gt;{' '}
				<a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/newsletter/issues/2022-08">
					All About Healthy Habits!
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				We spent August taking a step back, focusing on improving our habits and
				spaces. Shoutout to all the members who spent time improving
				organization and readmes or just took some time for reflection!
			</p>

			<h3 className="mb-3 font-italic">Volunteering at VC</h3>
			<p>
				Over the last few months, we've been trying to improve our documentation
				and support here at VC. We're very excited to be opening up membership!
				All of our active volunteers have an invite to send out to someone
				interested in joining Virtual Coffee. If you're interested in joining
				the volunteer team, check out some the roles{' '}

				💡 Monthly Theme &amp; Challenge:{' '}

					Preptember
				</a>
				!
			</h4>
			<p>
				This month, we have two tracks. Maintainers will be reviewing their open
				source repos with our checklist to make sure their projects are ready
				for Hacktoberfest contributions, and our contributors will be looking at
				their favorite repos, evaluating them based on the guide, and writing
				good issues as needed to fulfill the criteria.
			</p>
			<p>
				This month, we have resources for both project maintainers and potential
				project contributors. If it's your first time working with OSS, or
				you're just nervous and looking for support, we've got you covered.
			</p>
			<p>
				We'll do weekly check-ins, have avenues for Q&A, and provide our usual
				friendly environments for collaboration!
			</p>
			<p>
