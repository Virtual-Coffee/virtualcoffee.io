<h1>
	<small>Monthly Challenge for September, 2021:</small>
	Preptember! Get open source ready.
</h1>

<p class="lead">
	This month, we have two tracks. Maintainers will be reviewing their open
	source repos with
	<a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/member-resources/oss-maintainer-checklist/"
		>our checklist</a
	>
	to make sure their projects are ready for Hacktoberfest contributions, and our
	contributors will be looking at their favorite repos and writing good issues
	as needed.

<h2>Theme</h2>
<p>Get open source ready!</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>
	<strong>Maintainers</strong>: Evaluate your open source project and complete
	the checklist before the end of September.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Contributors</strong>: Following the guide, create and submit a good
	issue to one of your favorite open source repos.
</p>
<h2>Maintainers</h2>
<p>
	Preparing your open source project for contributions is one of the best ways
	to create a community of contributors that last beyond Hacktoberfest. Your
	repository should have a clear path for communication, a good explanation of
	how to run the project, and clear issues.
	<a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/member-resources/oss-maintainer-checklist/"
		>Our guide</a
	>
	will help you to not only prepare your project, but to be added to the list of
	Virtual Coffee endorsed projects for our Hacktoberfest Initiative.
</p>

<h2>Contributors</h2>
<p>
	The first step in becoming a good contributor is being able to navigate an
	open source repository and understand the time and effort maintainers put in
	to making sure their projects are welcoming to contributors. Writing an issue
	ensures that you have an understanding of the communication process, you've
	done the work to make sure that the same issue doesn't exist, and you've
	clearly described the need for the issue and have provided any information or
	screenshots necessary to help others to understand how to navigate the issue.
	Remember, you don't have to have the solution, just to be able to clearly
	explain the issue.
</p>

<h2>How to Participate</h2>

<h4>Weekly check-ins</h4>
<p>
	Are you making progress? Every Monday of the month, set your goals for the
	week and let's check-in on Fridays in slack.
</p>
<p><strong>Example Goals for Week One</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Maintainers</strong> - Review your README and CONTRIBUTING.md files.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Contributors</strong> - Look through your favorite repos to see if
		there's an issue you could create.
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>How do I share my progress?</h4>
<p>
	Share your progress in the #monthly-challenge channel in Slack. While no other
	platform is imposed, it can be a good idea to also share on social media for
	more reach but only if you are comfortable to do so (Twitter using -or not-
	the hashtag #VCMonthlyChallenge, a personal blog, a post on
	<a href="https://dev.to/">DEV.to</a>, you get the idea)
</p>

<p>
	Sharing every time some work is added is a good idea, small progress is still
	progress. No need to write a detailed blog post: a 140 characters Tweet can be
	enough. For example:
	<i
		>Today I updated my README to give instructions on how to run my project.</i
	>
</p>
<h4>What if I need help?</h4>
<p>
	You can ask a question in the #help-and-pairing VC channel, ask for ideas in
	the #open-source channel, or join the VC co-working room. Asking for help is
	part of the process!
</p>
<p>And remember, we're always here to help ❤️</p>

<h4>Completing the Challenge!</h4>
<p>
	Once you've completed the challenge, post a link to your issue in slack or to
	your open source repository
	<a href="https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/discussions/321"
		>in our discussion</a
	>.
