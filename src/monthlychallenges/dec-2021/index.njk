<h2 class="mt-5">The Challenge</h2>
<p>
    Devs are more than just the code we write. This month is all about embracing the aspects of yourself beyond the text editor. Give back to yourself by indulging in something just for fun. Share the art, music, poetry, sports, games, or any other hobbies that spark joy for you. We spend so much time grinding away on understanding things in the tech space. <em>Let's make some space for the other parts of ourselves</em>.
</p>
<p>
    We're encouraging folks to spend time this month working on things that aren't necessarily code specific, or using code to improve other hobbies and outlets.  Let the rest of VC know what you've got going on. You don't have to share your work, but we'd love to see and celebrate your achievements.  It can also be a great time to explore new hobbies and activities. If someone is doing something you're interested in, this is the month to learn more and maybe give it a try.
</p>
