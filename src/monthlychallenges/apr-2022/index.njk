	<small>Monthly Challenge for April, 2022:</small> Get job ready! Resumes,
	Portfolios, Cover Letters, and Elevator Pitch
</h1>

<p class="lead">
	It is never a bad thing to keep your job packet updated, and we're going to
	challenge you to do it, whether or not you're actively applying to jobs.
</p>

<p class="lead">
	During this month, we'll work on creating, revising, or updating your job
	packet materials and that elevator pitch that might get you in the door. Each
	week, we'll work on a new piece, starting with the resume.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Theme</h2>
<p>Get job ready! Resumes, Portfolios, Cover Letters, and Elevator Pitch</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
To end the month with:
<ul>
	<li>A complete and updated resume tailored to your job search or position</li>
	<li>
		A plan for updating or creating your portfolio with clear and actionable
		steps
	</li>
	<li>
		A complete and updated Cover Letter that creates a personal connection
	</li>
	<li>A captivating elevator pitch</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who can participate?</h3>
<p>
	Virtual Coffee's goal is to support all developers, no matter where they are
	in their coding journey. We encourage all members to participate.
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		We're focusing on creating job application materials. Whether you're
		actively looking, getting ready to look, or just want to update your
		materials in case that dream job comes along, this is a great time to do it
		with the community and to get some feedback.
	</li>
	<li>
		We encourage you to post your ideas, questions, and even your fears in
		#tech-interview-study-group channel in Slack. We're all learning and growing
		together!
	</li>
	<li>
		Each week, we'll do a slack check-in to brainstorm, support, and learn from
		each other.
	</li>
	<li>
		Keep in mind that different experiences will have different approaches to
		the materials, but we can all provide positive feedback.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Each week, we'll cover something new.</h3>
<h5>Weeks one and two: Resume and Cover Letter</h5>
<h6>Resume</h6>
<ul>
	<li>Step one: Find a job post.</li>
	<li>Step two: Match your skills to the post.</li>
	<li>Step three: Make your resume standout.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Cover Letter</h6>
<ul>
	<li>
		Step one: Do some research. Learn about the company and make a connection.
	</li>
	<li>
		Step two: Do some storytelling. A CL isn't a written resume. It's an
		opportunity to go deeper.
	</li>
	<li>Step three: Connect your experience to the position.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Weeks three and four: portfolio and elevator</h5>
<h6>Portfolio</h6>
<ul>
	<li>
		Step one: Create a clear purpose. Your portfolio should reflect the skills
		you would apply at your ideal job.
	</li>
	<li>Step two: Use a medium that works best for you.</li>
	<li>Step three: Create a connection.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Elevator Pitch</h6>
<ul>
	<li>
		An elevator pitch is a short speech introducing yourself, what you do or
		your experience, and why you would be a good person to have on the team. The
		idea is to confidently convey information about yourself in a short amount
		of time and to leave an impression on the mind of the person who hears it.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Each week, our project lead will start us off with some questions and
	resources. For this challenge to be fruitful, make sure you're sharing,
	providing feedback, and asking for help when you need it.
