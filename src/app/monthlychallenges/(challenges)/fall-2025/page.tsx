				<small>Bi-Monthly Challenge for Fall 2025:</small> Preptember &

			<p className="lead mt-5">
				This two-month challenge combines preparation and participation in open

			</p>

			<p className="lead mt-3">
				<strong>September (Preptember)</strong>: Focus on helping maintainers

				structured 4-week approach using our{' '}

				and building skills through guided practice.

			<p className="lead mt-3">

				<strong>October (Hacktoberfest)</strong>: Put your preparation into
				action by contributing to open source projects during the official

				<strong>September</strong>: Prep + Confidence Building - Get ready for
				open source!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>October</strong>: Hacktoberfest - Participate in open source,
				learn, and have fun!
			</p>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<h3>September: Preptember</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Goal</strong>: Help maintainers polish repos and contributors
				gain confidence through a structured 4-week approach.
			</p>

			<h3>October: Hacktoberfest</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Goal</strong>: Complete six meaningful contributions during
				October. We have two tracks:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Maintainers</strong>: Provide repositories with "
					<code>hacktoberfest</code>" topics and issues labeled "
					<code>hacktoberfest</code>"
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Contributors</strong>: Find repositories and solve issues to
					achieve six approved pull requests
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Community Issue</h2>
			<p className="mt-3">
				<strong>Preptember Accountability Issue</strong> → members comment
				weekly with their wins + GIFs to celebrate progress and keep each other
				motivated.
			</p>

			<h2>Maintainers</h2>
			<p className="mt-3">
				Preparing your open-source project for contributions is one of the best
				ways to create a community of contributors that lasts beyond
				Hacktoberfest. Your repository should have a clear path for
				communication, a good explanation of how to run the project, and
				well-written issues.{' '}
				<Link href="/resources/developer-resources/open-source/maintainer-guide">
					Our guide
				</Link>{' '}
				will help you prepare your project to be added to the list of Virtual
				Coffee-endorsed projects for our Hacktoberfest Initiative.
			</p>

			<h2>Contributors</h2>
			<p className="mt-3">
				The first step in becoming a good contributor is navigating an
				open-source repository and understanding the time and effort maintainers
				put into ensuring their projects are welcoming to contributors. As we
				move into Hacktoberfest season, we can support maintainers in their
				efforts to onboard new contributors. To complete this monthly challenge,
				find an open-source repository you'd like to contribute to and evaluate
				it based on our{' '}
				<Link href="/resources/developer-resources/open-source/maintainer-guide#repository-checklist">
					repository checklist
				</Link>
				. If it doesn't meet our checklist requirements, add an issue or
				multiple issues, asking the maintainers to update the repository based
				on your feedback.
			</p>

			<h2>October: Hacktoberfest Participation</h2>
			<p className="lead mt-3">
				After preparing in September, it's time to participate in the official
				Hacktoberfest!
			</p>

			<h3>Before Starting Hacktoberfest</h3>
			<p className="mt-3">
				<strong>Contributors</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Sign up on the{' '}
					<a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">
						Hacktoberfest official website
					</a>
					.
				</li>
				<li>
					Check out repositories with the "<code>hacktoberfest</code>" topic and
					issues on GitHub with the "<code>hacktoberfest</code>" label.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>Maintainers</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Make sure you include "<code>hacktoberfest</code>" as a label in your
				project's topics section (found in the "About" section on your
				repository) or on the issues you want to opt-in to the event. That's how
				you opt-in to Hacktoberfest.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/participation#maintainers">
					Check out all of the Hacktoberfest guidelines on the official website
				</a>
				.
			</p>

			<h3>October Weekly Check-ins</h3>
			<p className="mt-3">
				Let's start the week with a check-in. You can find the check-ins in the{' '}
				<code>#monthly-challenge</code> channel in Slack. What are your goals
				for Hacktoberfest for the week? What support do you need? Do you plan on
				spending time in the <code>#co-working-room</code>, talking to a mentee,
				or answering questions in Slack as a maintainer?
			</p>

			<h3>Completing Hacktoberfest</h3>
			<p className="mt-3">
				To complete the Hacktoberfest challenge, you need to complete six
				meaningful contributions during October.
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember, VC is here to support you during Hacktoberfest but is not an
				official event partner. To complete the official Hacktoberfest, you must
				have six (6) pull requests (PRs) accepted.
			</p>

			<h3>Virtual Coffee Approved Repositories for Hacktoberfest</h3>
			<p className="mt-3">
				Check back in October for our curated list of Virtual Coffee approved
				repositories that will be ready for Hacktoberfest contributions!
			</p>

			<h3>Share Your Progress!</h3>
			<p className="mt-3">
				Share your progress in the <code>#monthly-challenge</code> channel in
				Slack. While no other platform is imposed, sharing on social media for
				more reach can be a good idea, but only if you are comfortable doing so.
				You can share on social media, in a personal blog, in a post on{' '}
				<a href="https://dev.to/">DEV.to</a>, you get the idea!
			</p>
			<p>
				Sharing every time some work is added is a good idea. Small progress is
				still progress. There is no need to write a detailed blog post. A social
				media post can be enough. For example, "
				<em>
					Today, I updated my README to give instructions on how to run my
					project.
				</em>
				"
			</p>

			<h3>What if I need help?</h3>
			<p className="mt-3">
				You can ask questions in the <code>#help-and-pairing</code> channel in
				Slack, ask for ideas in the <code>#open-source</code> channel, or join
				the <code>#co-working-room</code>. Asking for help is part of the
				process!
			</p>
			<p>And remember, we're always here to help. ❤️</p>
