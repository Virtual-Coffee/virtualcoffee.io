			<p>
				Devs are more than just the code we write. This month is all about
				embracing self-expression. Give back to yourself by indulging in
				something just for fun. Share the art, music, poetry, sports, games, or
				other hobbies that spark your joy. We spend so much time grinding away
				on understanding things in the tech space.{' '}
				<em>Let's make some space for the other parts of ourselves</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We're encouraging you to spend time this month working on things that
				aren't necessarily code-specific or using code to improve other hobbies
				and outlets. Let the rest of VC know what you've got going on. You don't
				have to share your work, but we'd love to see and celebrate your
				achievements. It can also be a great time to explore new hobbies and
				activities. If someone is doing something you're interested in, this is
				the month to learn more and give it a try.
			</p>
