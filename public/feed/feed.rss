    <description><![CDATA[<p>Virtual Coffee is an intimate community for developers at all stages of the journey. In the Virtual Coffee Podcast, hosted by Bekah Hawrot Weigel and Dan Ott, you'll find interviews with members of our community to learn more about their stories, who they are, how they found Virtual Coffee, and how it has influenced their lives as developers. We want to bring everything that's special about Virtual Coffee, the intimacy and the friendships we’ve built, and share that with everyone through the podcast. We’re always growing and learning together as a group, and there’s something really special about being able to do that knowing that you’ll have the full support of the community around you. And that’s what this podcast is about too.</p>]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Dan and Bekah talk to Ayu about the impact of community, being a prolific blogger, and the very real challenge of burnout. Ayu&apos;s openness about the challenges of being a mom on the self-taught track into tech, isolation, and fears of not being good enough are the stories that we don&apos;t share enough of. Because when we share, we can all work through them together.
